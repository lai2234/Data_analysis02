# As we see through the graph, people who make less than $60k average per year are less likely to get parking ticket.
# We can also see the maximum number of parking enforcement requests are the people who make $120k average income.
# To conclude, I do not see the association between the parking enforcement requests and mean household income.
# I personally believe it is based on individual's driving behavior and not upon the amount of mean household income.

plt.scatter(ndf["MedianHHincome"],ndf["Number of Parking Enforcement Requests for Each Ward"])
plt.title("Median Household Income over Number of Parking Enforcement Requests")

# As we see in the scatter plot, the median household income that are below 40k are less likely to get parking ticket.
# The maximum number of parking enforcement requests are the household who make nearly $90k median
# To conclude, there is no association between the parking enforcemenet requests and median household income.
